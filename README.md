# Chat (WebSocket server)

1) Run the WebSocket server from task2 folder via command: npm run start
After that server will be available on ws://localhost:8080
2) The task is to implement the chat that can broadcast messages between 2 or more different windows as it is shown on the screenshot bellow.
3) Message should contain username, time and text content.  

- Pay attention that you will not receive your own messages from server, you should connect at least 2 different browser windows to it, so that way one will send message and the other will receive it (and vice versa).
- You can use prompt() to ask user for his name when opening the chat.
- It is not required to strictly follow the layout and styles shown on the screenshot.
- You can edit any files in client folder.
